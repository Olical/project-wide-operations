# Project-wide operation in Vim

## Creating, finding and editing across a project

Deck for a talk I'm giving at [Vim London][]. Uses [Vimdeck][].

I've added a tiny binding in `.lvimrc` (which is sourced automatically by [vim-localvimrc][]) to make compiling the current file and running it with [Vimdeck][] really easy. Just hit `<localleader>r`.
